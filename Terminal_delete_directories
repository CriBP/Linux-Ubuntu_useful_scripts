There are lot of way to delete a directory through CLI mode. It depend which way you are conformable.

    rm -rvf /path/to/directory

    -r = remove directories and their contents recursively
    -v = explain what is being done
    -f = ignore nonexistent files, never prompt

If you are new in Linux, use man page's of commands (man rm) for more option and more accuracy.
