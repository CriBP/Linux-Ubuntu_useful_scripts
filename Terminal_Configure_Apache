- How to configure Apache Server:
sudo apt install apache2
apache2 -version
sudo ufw app list
sudo ufw allow Apache
sudo ufw status
sudo systemctl status apache2
hostname -i
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/info.net.conf
<VirtualHost *:80>
	# The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
	# the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
	# redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
	# specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
	# match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
	# value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
	# However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
	#ServerName www.example.com

	ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
	#DocumentRoot /var/www/html
	DocumentRoot /media/5TB-WDC-EasyStore/Web

	# Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,
	# error, crit, alert, emerg.
	# It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular
	# modules, e.g.
	#LogLevel info ssl:warn

	ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
	CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

	# For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are
	# enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to
	# include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the
	# following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
	# after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
	#Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf
</VirtualHost>

You'll have to edit apache2.conf and 000-default.conf to change the document root of apache.
The Apache server is installed on /var/www/html.This is the default root directory of apache.
Either change the root directory of Apache or move the project to /var/www/html.
    To change Apache's root directory, run:     cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
    Then open the 000-default.conf file using the command:     nano 000-default.conf
    Edit the DocumentRoot option:     DocumentRoot /path/to/my/project
    Then restart the apache server:     sudo service apache2 restart
If you get Forbidden You don't have permission to access / on this server after changing the root of apache then do follow these steps
    Find the apache2.conf located in /etc/apache2 and open it using:    sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
    Use Ctrl+W and search for Directory (It should be in line 153) It should look like this
<Directory />
   Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
   AllowOverride All
  Require all denied
</Directory>
    Change it to
<Directory />
  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI
  AllowOverride All
  Require all granted
</Directory>
    Restart apache     sudo service apache2 restart
