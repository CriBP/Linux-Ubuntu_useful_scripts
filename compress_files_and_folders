If you want to create an archive of a directory, you first need to create a tar archive, then bzip2 compress the archive; this is why “tarball”s often have the extension .tar.bz2

tar -cjvf file.tar.bz2 dir

     Type at the command prompt

        tar xvzf file-1.0.tar.gz - to uncompress a gzip tar file (.tgz or .tar.gz) 
        tar xvjf file-1.0.tar.bz2 - to uncompress a bzip2 tar file (.tbz or .tar.bz2) 
        tar xvf file-1.0.tar - to uncompressed tar file (.tar) 

        x = eXtract, this indicated an extraction c = create to create )
        v = verbose (optional) the files with relative locations will be displayed.
        z = gzip-ped; j = bzip2-zipped
        f = from/to file ... (what is next after the f is the archive file) 
    The files will be extracted in the current folder (most of the times in a folder with the name 'file-1.0').
