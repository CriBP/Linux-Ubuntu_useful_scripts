- How to Mount exFAT Drive on Ubuntu Linux: sudo apt install exfat-fuse exfat-utils

- How to mount external drive: sudo mount /dev/sdX /media/NAME 
sudo fdisk -l
sudo blkid
sudo mkdir /data
sudo nano /etc/fstab
UUID=14D82C19D82BF81E /data    auto nosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show 0 0
Breaking that line down, we have:
    UUID=14D82C19D82BF81E - is the UUID of the drive. You don't have to use the UUID here. You could just use /dev/sdj, but it's always safer to use the UUID as that will never change (whereas the device name could).
    /data - is the mount point for the device.
    auto - automatically determine the file system
    nosuid - specifies that the filesystem cannot contain set userid files. This prevents root escalation and other security issues.
    nodev - specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special devices (to prevent access to random device hardware).
    nofail - removes the errorcheck.
    x-gvfs-show - show the mount option in the file manager. If this is on a GUI-less server, this option won't be necessary.
    0 - determines which filesystems need to be dumped (0 is the default).
    0 - determine the order in which filesystem checks are done at boot time (0 is the default).
Save and close the file. 
sudo mount -a
