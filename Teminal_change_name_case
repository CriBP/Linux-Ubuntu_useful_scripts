hange Case:

For each file a_file in current directory rename a_file to lower case.
for a_file in *;do mv -v "$a_file" `echo "$a_file" | tr [:upper:] [:lower:]` ;done;
For upper case reverse the arguments to [:lower:] [:upper:]
If you know what file extensions you're dealing with, you can hard-code it:

for f in *.JPG
do
  mv -v "$f" "${f%.JPG}.jpg"
done

For the more-general case:

for f in *
do 
  e="${f##*.}"
  b="${f%.*}"
  mv -v "$f" "${b}.${e,,}"
done
